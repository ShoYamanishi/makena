 *
 * @brief Solves Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem or MLCP for
 *        a symmetric PD matrix with the algorithm presented in [MNS08].
 *
 *         |     |     | | |   | |   | |
 *         |  A  |  C  | |u|   |a|   |0|
 *         |     |     | | |   | |   | |
 *         |-----+-----|*|-| + |-| = |-|
 *         |   t |     | | |   | |   | |    
 *         |  C  |  B  | |v|   |b|   |w|  
 *         |     |     | | |   | |   | |, b >= 0, w >= 0, bÂ·w = 0
 *
 *        In a simplified form, we express the above as Mz + q = w.
 *
 *        The algorithm is called projected Gauss-Seidel with subspace
 *        minimization proposed in MNS08.
 *        The partition of the matrix above is for illustration purpose only
 *        and both unilateral and bilateral constraints can be ordered 
 *        arbitrarily.
 *        The solutions for bilateral constraints can have limits (boxed 
 *        constraints.) The boxed constraints must be carefully used to keep
 *        the feasibility of the entire problem.
 *
 * @usage

 *    VarVec q     (matrixSize, true, true); // RHS vector
